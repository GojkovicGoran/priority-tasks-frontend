- Task which name contains only space characters should not be accepted. trim() can help you
- taskItem.js, line 6 : each task has same id but it should not be a case, id must be unique.If multiple tags need same
  style use class instead of id
- task name and buttons(postpone, delete) are not centered at all, set them in same line
- div that holds task name is whole clickable, make only task name clickable or create done button
- if task name is too long e.g. 150 characters(probably it would never happen but...), or if you use app on cell phone(e.g. 350px)
  it wont be completely visible probably because you use css property - overflow-x: hidden; check out word-break or word-wrap in css
- Please change orange color
